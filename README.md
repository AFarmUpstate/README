# A Farm, Upstate

This is a nice place. Somewhere for your once loved project to come live.
<a href="https://afarmupstate.github.io/README/">There might be reasons</a>. 

# How do I send you my project?

Go to the *Project Settings*, go to **Transfer ownership** and send it to AFarmUpstate. 

We'll take your project in and give it home. You won't have to answer emails about support questions anymore. You won't have to worry about updates, or 
all the other stresses. 

# Will you do bad things to it?

Nope. We'll add the tags to indicate that this is abandoned. If someone 
offers to take over your abandoned project, we may let them adopt it (unless
you tell us not to). 

You'll be free to come visit any time, of course.
