<h1>Unloved Puppies</h1>
<h2>A digital farm, upstate.</h2>
<div id="main">
<p>It happens. Sure, at first, it brought you joy. You'd look forward to getting home from work so you could play with it for hours. It was sleek, powerful, elegant.</p>
<p>And then... well, then it was older. It was less sleek, or maybe it was a little broken. You still loved it. How could you not? But you found yourself neglecting it more and more.</p>
<p>Don't feel bad. Everyone has at least one in their life.</p>
<p>The Old Project. Your digital unloved puppy.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a website. Maybe it was an app. Maybe it was just a library that sorted playing cards. Whatever it was, it's now a bit less loved. </p>
<p>That's why we're here. We'll take your unloved project and move it to a repo upstate, where it can play with lots of other unloved projects and chase rabbits and never, ever be dropped into a lake. No more feeling guilty about listening to your project whine, instead it will be free to laugh and play and probably not be eaten by bears.</p>
<p>Yes, no more moving it to a forgotten folder on an old drive because "you'll get around to playing with that just as soon as you get some time." Just let us adopt it and we'll give it the love and attention that it deserves. And by love and attention we definitely don't mean a dropping it into a running wood-chipper.</p>
<br>
<p>Most of the time.</p>
<p>Well, now there's somewhere you can send your unloved puppy.</p>
<p>You can send it to <a href="https://github.com/AFarmUpstate">A farm, upstate</a> where it can play and chase rabbits and not wonder why Farmer Jason has a loaded shotgun. Just transfer your puppy to AFarmUpstate, and we'll handle the rest. </p>
<p>Peacefully.</p>
<p>In a corn field.</p>
<p>Behind the woodshed.</p>
